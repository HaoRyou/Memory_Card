# Pokémon Memory Challenge

Test your memory and focus with **Pokémon Memory Challenge**!

In this game, you’ll see a grid filled with Pokémon pictures, all randomly placed. Your goal is simple:

- **Click on a Pokémon you haven’t clicked before** to earn **+1 point**.
- After each click, all the Pokémon shuffle to new positions, keeping you on your toes.

But be careful — if you **click the same Pokémon twice**, it’s **Game Over**!  
Your current score resets, and your best score is saved so you can try to beat it next time.

How many Pokémon can you remember before making a mistake?  
Sharpen your memory, aim for a high score, and catch ‘em all!
